Compuatational Geomtery was initially used for pattern recognintion. It has also been used often to describe algorithms for manipulating curves and surfaces in solid modeling. Though it is widely being used in design and analysis of algorithms, in this project, I will try to mainly focus on multidimensional aspects using computational geometry. Because of its history, the field of computational geometry has focused mostly on problems in 2-dimensional space and to a lesser extent in 3-dimensional space. When problems are considered in multi-dimensional spaces, it is usually assumed that the dimension of the space is a small constant (say, 10 or lower). The key resources, which I have been using so far, include [these notes](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/754/Lects/754lects.pdf), and [this book](https://archive.org/details/designanalysisof00ahoarich/page/n7/mode/2up)
