Compuatational Geomtery was initially used for pattern recognintion. It has also been used often to describe algorithms for manipulating curves and surfaces in solid modeling. Though it is widely being used in design and analysis of algorithms, in this project, I will try to mainly focus on multidimensional aspects using computational geometry. Because of its history, the field of computational geometry has focused mostly on problems in 2-dimensional space and to a lesser extent in 3-dimensional space. When problems are considered in multi-dimensional spaces, it is usually assumed that the dimension of the space is a small constant (say, 10 or lower). However, it is a limitation of Computational Geometry that ot mostly deals with flat and straight surfaces, but it is possible to approximate curved objects with piecewise planar polygons or polyhedra. This assumption has freed computational geometry to deal with the combinatorial elements of most of the problems, as opposed to dealing with numerical issues. This is one of the things that makes computational geometry fun to study, you do not have to learn a lot of analytic or differential geometry to do it. But, it does limit the applications of computational geometry.  The key resources, which I have been using so far, include [these notes](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/754/Lects/754lects.pdf), and [this book](https://archive.org/details/designanalysisof00ahoarich/page/n7/mode/2up). 
Before delwing into the multidimensional space, some basic things are required, which are mentioned in the [notes](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/754/Lects/754lects.pdf)
