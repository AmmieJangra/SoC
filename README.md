Compuatational Geomtery was initially used for pattern recognintion. It has also been used often to describe algorithms for manipulating curves and surfaces in solid modeling. Though it is widely being used in design and analysis of algorithms, in this project, I will try to mainly focus on multidimensional aspects using computational geometry.
